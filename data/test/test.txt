Belling the Cat Long ago, the mice had a general council to consider what measures The Mice could take to outwit The Mice's common enemy, the Cat. Some said this, and some said that; but at last a young mouse got up and said A Young Mouse had a proposal to make, which A Young Mouse thought would meet the case. “The Mice will all agree,” said A Young Mouse, “that our chief danger consists in the sly and treacherous manner in which The Cat approaches us. Now, if we could receive some signal of The Cat's approach, we could easily escape from The Cat. A Young Mouse venture, therefore, to This Proposal that a small bell be procured, and attached by a ribbon round the neck of The Cat. By this means we should always know when The Cat was about, and could easily retire while The Cat was in the neighbourhood.” This proposal met with general applause, until an old mouse got up and said: “That is all very well, but who is to bell The Cat?” The Mice looked at one another and nobody spoke. Then An Old Mouse said: “It is easy to propose impossible remedies.”
